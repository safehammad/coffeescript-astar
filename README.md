# CoffeeScript A* Maze Solver

An implementation of the A* algorithm in CoffeeScript implemented as a maze solver.  Although this particular implementation is specific to solving basic mazes, the A* implementation should be easy to generalise.

A sample implementation is provided in `index.html` which visualises the maze using SVG via the [Raphael] JavaScript library (included). The location of the start point can be altered by clicking anywhere on the maze.
