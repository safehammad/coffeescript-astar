Although this particular implementation is specific to solving basic mazes, the A* implementation should be easy to generalise.\r\n\r\nA sample implementation is provided in `index.html` which visualises the maze using SVG via the [Raphael] JavaScript library (included). The location of the start point can be altered by clicking anywhere on the maze.\r\n\r\n[Raphael]: http://raphaeljs.com/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
